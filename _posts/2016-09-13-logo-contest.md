We are looking for talented, innovative graphic designers to participate in a logo design contest for our organization! We will choose the logo that we believe best reflects our organization’s mission and values. The logo will be used on letterheads of official documents, the MIRCA website, and business cards. 

**Who We Are:** MIRCA is a non-profit organization that promotes the greater appreciation of Russian language and culture. MIRCA is in the process of expanding from its startup, the Russian Cultural Exchange, into an organization that provides various educational and social networking events for Russian and non-Russian speakers.

**Reward:** The contestant with the winning design will receive a $100.00 plus five (5) passes to all MIRCA events held at Anticafe ($50.00 value; valid until May 2017), as well as promotional visibility and design credits on our MIRCA website and social media platforms. 

**Submission Criteria:** Final submissions for the web version should be submitted in 72 DPI, RVB; the print document version should be in at least 300 DPI, CMYK. The print document version should contain a bleed of 0.25in. Both document must be submitted in PDF format. Please visit mirca.ca/logo-contest to view existing prototypes for logo designs. Deadlines for final submissions must be submitted to [russianculturalexchange@gmail.com](mailto: russianculturalexchange@gmail.com) with “MIRCA Logo Design Contest” in the subject line. Documents may be sent as attachments or a link to your online file sharing (i.e., Dropbox) by Friday, September 30th, 2016. No restrictions in terms of content! We encourage your creative use of images, lettering, drawings, etc!

**INFO SESSION** will be held on **Thursday, September 20th at 6:30p.m.** We will explain MIRCA’s mission and values, why the existing logotypes are not suitable for the organization, and answer any questions.
