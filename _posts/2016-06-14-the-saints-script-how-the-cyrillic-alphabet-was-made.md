Vladimir Ivantsov, doctoral canditate of Russian Studies at McGill University, will talk on the origins of the Cyrillic script, on which the modern alphabets of many Slavic (and several non-Slavic) languages are based (Belarusian, Bulgarian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian and others).

Created in the 9th century, the Cyrillic alphabet was named after Saint Cyril, a Byzantine Christian missionary. The saint brothers, Cyril and Methodius, are considered the founders of the first Slavic alphabet. It is less known, though, that the alphabet they invented was the Glagolitic alphabet, which is completely different from the familiar Cyrillic script.

This talk, dedicated to Saints Cyril and Methodius Day (in Russian known as День славянской письменности и культуры – Slavonic Literature and Culture Day), addresses the invention of the first Slavic alphabets, their original structure and functions, and the similarities and differences between the original Cyrillic script and contemporary Russian alphabet.

Presentation in English.
